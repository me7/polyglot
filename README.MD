# Polyglot
Learn programming in several languages

https://github.com/me7/polyglot.git

## About
This repo use for reference of programming launguages I've learned.
`I-O-If-For-Func` is the method I use when start learning new language

```mermaid
graph LR
I --> If/For/Func --> O
```
it's consist of studying
- input = from keyboard, file, database, network, sensor
- output = to screen, file, database, network, motor
- if = decision making: if, switch
- for = looping: for, while
- func = compress many things in one word: 
  - same file (proc, func)
  - other file (module)


## Why Study by this path?
very basic things is input --> process --> output. But you can replace process with either computer or human
  - input --> human --> output
  - input --> computer --> output

However, replace human with computer is better because of these 3 things

### If (Decision)
Computer we do whatever you tell them todo everytime
- if gotSalary: save 30%
- if morning: run 5km
- if mondayMorning: send weekly report

you (human) not have discipline to do the same everytime condition is met. That's why the quote "through discipline comes freedom" still true today

### For (Repetition)
Computer not tired, it's can do work 24/7
- human do 1 report = easy. 1000 report = WTF!
- computer do 1 report = easy. 1000 report = easy

### Func (brevity)
there're 2 things on this items. in same file: study how to extract many line to function, in other file: study how to export / import function

Human can do task if you explain to him correctly, but maybe in next 7 days you have to explain to him again. For computer you teach it one time and named it (create function). next time you just call the function again to got same result. easy!!

Human have difficulty to transfer knowledge from one person to another but in computer this problem is not exist. Want to do something you dont have knowledge to do? if someone already teach computer to do it. Just import and use. easy!
(see XKCD comics of python language - "import anti-gravity")
